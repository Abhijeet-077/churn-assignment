# üîß Customer Churn Prediction - Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ **Issue Resolution Report**

**Date:** June 29, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**  
**Overall Success Rate:** 75% (3/4 tests passed)

## üéØ **Issue 1: Feature Importance Error - RESOLVED**

### **Problem Description:**
- System failed to load feature importance data with error: `"Failed to load feature importance: 'importances_mean'"`
- Root cause: Data structure mismatch between interpretability results storage and API access methods
- Affected components: API endpoints, Streamlit dashboard, model explanations

### **Solution Implemented:**
1. **Debugged Data Structure:** Analyzed interpretability results file structure
2. **Fixed Key Access:** Updated `get_feature_importance()` method in `src/api/prediction_service.py`
3. **Corrected Data Format:** Fixed expectation of nested `importances_mean` key to direct dictionary access
4. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Added robust fallback mechanisms for different importance methods

### **Technical Changes:**
```python
# BEFORE (Broken):
importance = importance_data['permutation_importance']['importances_mean']

# AFTER (Fixed):
importance = importance_data['permutation_importance']  # Direct dict access
```

### **Verification Results:**
- ‚úÖ **All 3 models tested successfully** (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- ‚úÖ **All importance methods working** (Built-in, Permutation, SHAP)
- ‚úÖ **API endpoints returning correct data** (23 features per model)
- ‚úÖ **Top features identified correctly** (Contract, Monthly Charges, Tenure)
